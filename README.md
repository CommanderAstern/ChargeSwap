**Problem Statement:**
The world is shifting to Electric Vehicles especially With the increasing demand for clean energy and the need to reduce emissions. Governments around the world are investing heavily in EV infrastructure and incentives, while automakers are developing new models with improved range and performance and implementing models that involve usage of electricity or even hybrid models. Battery technology is also advancing rapidly, mainly with either battery charging or with battery swapping. However, although there has been support for charging stations, it is much lesser for stations that have swappable batteries. Swappable batteries are faster, convenient and more efficient than charging stations hence there needs to be good software and hardware that supports this. Blockchain can help with the software infrastructure while IoT can handle the hardware infrastructure.

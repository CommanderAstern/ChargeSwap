## Problem Statement
The world is shifting to Electric Vehicles especially With the increasing demand for clean energy and the need to reduce emissions. Governments around the world are investing heavily in EV infrastructure and incentives, while automakers are developing new models with improved range and performance and implementing models that involve usage of electricity or even hybrid models. Battery technology is also advancing rapidly, mainly with either battery charging or with battery swapping. However, although there has been support for charging stations, it is much lesser for stations that have swappable batteries. Swappable batteries are faster, convenient and more efficient than charging stations hence there needs to be good software and hardware that supports this. Blockchain can help with the software infrastructure while IoT can handle the hardware infrastructure.

## Solution
There is a need for a safe, secure, public and fast battery swapping system. Blockchain technology would ensure that the transactions are secure and immutable, while IoT would enable the tracking of the batteryâ€™s location and usage. So there needs to be a system that enables it. We call it ChargeSwap. ChargeSwap allows the user to seamlessly make a simple transaction to the system and get their discharged batteries swapped for batteries with 100% charge with the lowest costs possible. Additionally, we would implement this system only when there is a renewable source of energy that distributes energy to the battery swapping station because we ultimately do not want the user to pay more through gas and spend more electricity to get more electricity - hence it would make sense for the source of the energy of these charging stations is renewable. IoT would help in tracking and managing the battery information.

## Target Market
We are mainly targetting users who own and/or drive Electric Vehicles, especially the vehicles that are 
Although the current market may not seem to be a big one, within the next 10 years this will be a helpful innovation as the world is shifting to EVs - this claim is backed by credible predictions from the government which states that 30% vehicles in India alone would be electric.

## Objective/Goal
Our goal is to be among the first innovators in this space of EV which involves battery swapping. We want to make an impact on all EV users especially the ones who use EVs that utilize battery swapping techniques.
